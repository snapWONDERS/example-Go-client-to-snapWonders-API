snapWonders â€” Deep digital media analysis, format conversions, steganography, scrubbing and regeneration. Providing digital media solutions


# Example Go client to snapWonders API
The objective of this repository is to provide a Go Client client example to snapWONDERS API. This includes a setup-by-step
guide how to set up your development environment, the example source code and instructions on how to test and run.

Through the example source, you will be able to:
* Upload digital media
* Perform deep digital media analysis, reveal hidden metadata, hidden metadata, copyrights, steganography and private information leakage
* Display the results from the analysis


# Installation and setup

## Development environment
For the development environment you will need:
* Install Visual Studio Code. You can download and install from [visual code studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Install the Go programming language if you have not done so. Simply follow the instructions from [go programming language](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* Install the plugin into Visual Studio Code called "Go". See image below for details: 

## snapWONDERS API Key
You will need the snapWONDERS API Key before you can get started:
* Signup and create an account at snapWONDERS at [signup](https://snapwonders.com/sign-up). If you wish to create account via Tor or I2P then you can do so by accessing snapWONDERS via the Tor or I2P portals. For the dark web links visit [browsing safely](https://snapwonders.com/browsing-safely)
* Under your account settings, scroll to the bottom under the section "API Settings" and click the button to generate your Auth API key
* Copy this key directly into the `main.go` file under the constant `SNAPWONDERS_API_KEY`


# Running the Go example
Once everything above is setup you should be able to simply open the workspace folder with Visual Studio Code and run or debug it. Simply hit the default hot keys `F5` to start debugging or to run directly use `Ctrl+F5`.

If you wish you can change and provide your own digital media to upload (images and/or videos) and change the `MEDIA_PATH_FILENAME` constant contained in the `main.go` file.

You should see the standard output like something like below:
